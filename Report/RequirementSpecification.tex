\chapter{Requirement Specification}
The system requirements is divided into two sections; functional ad non-functional requirements. A standard approach to capture the functional requirements would be to use SysML/UML Use Cases. However due to the simplicity of this project it has been chosen to keep the functional requirements simple and only use one line statements.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Non-Functional requirements}

	\item The resolution of the image shall be 512 x 512 pixels.
