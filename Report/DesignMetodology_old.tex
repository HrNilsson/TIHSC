\begin{enumerate}
\item Motivation. Why do we do all this?
\item List/create functional and non-functional requirements, and possibly specify optimization goals.
\item Block diagram using SysML. This gives a overview of the system
\item Activity diagram using SysML. This gives a better understanding for the flow through the system.
\item HW/SW mapping.
\item Design Space Exploration.
\item Graphical SystemC Model. Describe everything on a transaction level, using processes and channels.
\item Convert the graphical model to SystemC code and insert approximate times.
\item Refine the SystemC model to a Bus Cycle Accurate Model, by adding adapters with real bus signals etc.
\item Evaluate if the created BCAM model is good enough, otherwise refine the model.
\item Further work:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Refine the BCAM to CAM.
\item Evaluation
\item Implementation
\end{enumerate}
