\chapter{Design Metodology}

\section{Motivation}
Why do we do all this?

\section{Requirement specification}
List/create functional and non-functional requirements, and possibly specify optimization goals.

\section{SysML}
Creation of a block diagram. This gives a overview of the system

Activity diagram. This gives a better understanding for the flow through the system.

HW/SW mapping. Which processes could be parallelized? Which processes is time consuming? What are the requirements?

Design Space Exploration.


\section{SystemC - TLM}
Graphical SystemC Model. Describe everything on a transaction level, using processes and channels.

Convert the graphical model to SystemC code and insert approximate times.

\section{SystemC - BCAM}
Refine the SystemC model to a Bus Cycle Accurate Model, by adding adapters with real bus signals etc.


\section{Evaluation}
Evaluate if the created BCAM model is good enough, otherwise refine the model.

\section{Further work}
Work not included in this project:
\subsection{SystemC - BCAM}
Refine the BCAM to CAM.

\subsection{Evaluation}
Evaluate if the created CAM model is good enough, otherwise refine the model.

\subsection{Implementation}
When the CAM model is good enough, implement the model on HW/SW.
